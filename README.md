# aoc2025
My Advent of Code 2025 attempt

Good luck to everyone trying!

# Notes

# Day 0
- I've put input.txt into my .gitignore to be a better AOC participant. In the past, I committed input data, but apparantly the creator of AOC doesn't want input data to be aggregatable (so putting it online in a repo isn't so great)
- I haven't decided what language for this year. I am noodling around with using multiple languages, whatever is easiest for the challenge of the day.
